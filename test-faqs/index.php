				<p class="page-para-text text-justify pt-1 pb-1">The first things you hear when you researching about going abroad to study are some words like GMAT, GRE, TOEFL and IELTS. What exactly are these? Well, to begin with, every student aspiring to join an educational institution in a foreign country is required to appear for an entrance exam similar to ones we have in India, viz-a-viz the IITJEE, AIEEE, etc. There are the usual aptitude tests such as SAT, GMAT & GRE and there are language proficiency exams such as IELTS (International English Language Testing System) and TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) for students from countries which do not have English as their native language.</p>
				<p class="page-para-text text-justify pt-1 pb-1">The IELTS test is standard for admission to most of the top universities around the globe, in addition, it is also required by professionals planning to work or migrate abroad. The test is divided into four modules, namely, Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. An average test taker usually takes up to 2 hours and 45 minutes to finish the test. The scoring scale on the IELTS is from 0-9, with different institutions having their own cut-offs. The IELTS tests are held at over 800 centres with tests up-to four times a month. The IELTS is available in two test formats, the IELTS Academic or the IELTS General Training. The Academic module is for candidates who wish to study at undergraduate or postgraduate levels, whereas the General training module is for candidates wishing to migrate to an English speaking country. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking components, but different Reading and Writing Components.</p>
